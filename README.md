# Leg-arm-Pencil-Dispenser

This project is my attempt at creating a pencil dispenser which you will snap(?) onto your leg, then just wave your hand over to get a pencil.

The basic idea of it is that there is a motion sensor on one side, which connects to an Arduino and a servo, opening a compartment, or pushing a pencil out.
